Road to a 0.3 release:

* Currently the categoriesdialog displays a colored square next to the category name, but it doesn't match the corresponding color yet. The create_pixbuf method expects a rgb (tuple) value but the record stores the hex value of the color.
* Make sure that maindialog also displays the category name and the colored image.
* Add verification routine to adddialog so that amount and category are validated prior to saving/updating a record.

*  Test and strengthen the updatetables method in DAL;
*  Table validation should take the version into account when making decisions.  If version in code is less than existing (in the db), we should not update;

*  Add a method of payment to database and UI, so user can select the method of payment for any given record.  For exemple, credit card, cash, check, etc.  In case of payment by check, allow user to enter the check number;  This should be good enough for this iteration;
